            "An elephant can use its tusks to dig for ground water. An adult elephant needs to drink around 210 litres of water a day.",
            "Elephants have large, thin ears. Their ears are made up of a complex network of blood vessels which help regulate their temperature. Blood is circulated through their ears to cool them down in hot climates.",
            "Elephants have no natural predators. However, lions will sometimes prey on young or weak elephants in the wild. The main risk to elephants is from humans through poaching and changes to their habitat."

            "A leopardâ€™s tail is just about as long as its entire body. This helps it with balance and enables it to make sharp turns quickly.",
            "Leopards protect their food from other animals by dragging it high up into the trees. A leopard will often leave their prey up in the tree for days and return only when they are hungry!"

            "Bears care deeply about family members. They will risk their lives and even fight to the death in order to save a cub or sibling from danger.",

            "A skunk will always give a warning before spraying: it turns its back to the target, hisses and stamps its feet.",
            "They have a variety of striped, spotted and swirled patterns but all are a vivid black and white which makes them easily identifiable.",
            "Skunks usually nest in burrows constructed by other animals, but they also live in hollow logs or even abandoned buildings."
